<h1 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>

In my day-job as a Senior Speech Engineer, naturally, I'm no stranger to shell scripting (awk, grep, sed, etc.), Python (numpy, ray, torch, sklearn, fastapi, nuclio, etc.), and web-scraping (scrapy, xpath, css-selectors), surfacing APIs (testing with Postman - Javascript), and trying to make them more robust (K8s, kibana, grafana, etc.).
However, more recently, I've been venturing deeper into the wonderous LLM jungle in all it's deep, swampy, exotic glory. To gauge how wedded I am to the shell, you should know that I am a Neovim advocate; I program my own text editors with Lua, and I'm opinionated about it.

Here you can find some of the public projects that I've been working on over the year(s).

One day I plan to order and list them properly here, until then, you can browse my public repositories.
