<h1 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>

In my day-job as a Senior Speech Engineer, naturally, I'm no stranger to shell scripting (awk, grep, sed, etc.), Python (numpy, ray, torch, sklearn, fastapi, nuclio, etc.), and web-scraping (scrapy, xpath, css-selectors), surfacing APIs (testing with Postman - Javascript), and trying to make them more robust (K8s, kibana, grafana, etc.). However, more recently, I've been venturing deeper into the LLM jungle. Finally, one more thing you should know about me, to gauge how wedded I am to the shell; I am a Neovim advocate.

Here you can find some of the public projects that I've been working on over the year(s).

One day I plan to order and list them properly here, until then, you can browse my public repositories.
