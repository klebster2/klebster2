<h1 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>

In my day-job as a Senior Speech Engineer, I'm no stranger to shell scripting, and Python (numpy, ray, torch, etc.), and web-scraping, etc. However, more recently, I've been venturing into the LLM jungle.

Here you can find some projects I've been working on over the year(s).

One day I plan to order and list them properly here, until then, you can browse my public repositories.
