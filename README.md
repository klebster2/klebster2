I currently work as a Speech Engineer. I'm no stranger to ASR, Bourne Again Shell (BASH) scripting and [customization](https://github.com/klebster2/dotfiles), Python, surfacing and testing APIs, and trying to make them more robust. I've also dabbled with Javascript, HTML, C & C++, to name a few.

At heart, I like to understand what I'm developing, and how best to make something of value reproducible.

To gauge how wedded I am to the shell, note that I am a Neovim advocate, and I _[try](https://github.com/klebster2/vimrc)_ to write functionality into my text editors with Lua or just plain old vim script.

Here you can find some of the public projects that I've been working on over the years.

One day I plan to order and list them properly here, until then, you can browse my public repositories, or visit my [projects page](https://klebster2.github.io/projects/)
