I currently work as a Speech Engineer. I'm no stranger to model training and evaluation, shell scripting, Python, surfacing and testing APIs, and trying to make them more robust.

To gauge how wedded I am to the shell, you should know that I am a Neovim advocate, and I (try) write functionality into my text editors with Lua.

Here you can find some of the public projects that I've been working on over the years.

One day I plan to order and list them properly here, until then, you can browse my public repositories, or visit this [projects page](https://klebster2.github.io/projects/)
