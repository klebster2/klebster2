<h1 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>

In my day job as a Senior Speech Engineer, working primarily on ASR and related speech technologies, I'm no stranger to model training and evaluation, shell scripting, Python, surfacing and testing APIs, and trying to make them more robust.

However, more recently, I've been venturing deeper into the weird and wonderful LLM jungle in all its strange glory.

To gauge how wedded I am to the shell, you should know that I am a Neovim advocate; I write functionality into my text editors with Lua

Here you can find some of the public projects that I've been working on over the years.

One day I plan to order and list them properly here, until then, you can browse my public repositories.
